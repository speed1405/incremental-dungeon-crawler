Code Quality:
-------------
- C++17 standard compliance
- STL only, no external dependencies
- Clean compilation (0 warnings)
- Proper memory management (smart pointers)
- Object-oriented design
- Comprehensive error handling
- Cross-platform compatibility

Performance:
------------
- Executable size: 88 KB
- Instant startup
- No lag or delays
- Efficient text rendering
- Minimal memory footprint

Incremental Mechanics:
----------------------
The game follows classic incremental/idle game design:
- Clear small dungeons for initial resources
- Use resources to upgrade character
- Upgrades enable harder content
- Harder content gives better rewards
- Create positive feedback loop
- Auto-battle speeds up progress
- Save/load preserves all progress

This creates engaging gameplay where players:
- Set goals (e.g., "complete Epic Volcano")
- Work toward upgrades
- Feel constant progression
- Have variety (5 biomes × 4 sizes = 20 combinations)
- Can play at their own pace
