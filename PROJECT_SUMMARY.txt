  2. FEATURES.md - Detailed feature list and technical specs
  3. demo_gameplay.txt - Gameplay walkthrough examples
  4. DEMONSTRATION.txt - Complete demonstration document
  5. GAME_SCREENS.txt - Visual representation of all game screens
  6. .gitignore - Clean repository configuration

BUILD SYSTEM
------------
Components:
  - Makefile - Cross-platform build configuration
  - build.sh - Automated build script with success reporting
  - test.sh - Automated test suite (6 tests)

Build Commands:
  make          - Build the game
  make clean    - Remove build artifacts
  make run      - Build and run the game
  ./build.sh    - Build with detailed output

Manual Compilation:
  g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o dungeon_crawler main.cpp game.cpp

Cross-Platform:
  Linux/macOS: make
  Windows (MinGW): mingw32-make
  Windows (MSVC): cl /EHsc /std:c++17 /Fe:dungeon_crawler.exe main.cpp game.cpp

TESTING
-------
Automated Tests:
  ✅ Executable creation
  ✅ Game launch and exit
  ✅ Save game functionality
  ✅ Dungeon entry and flee
  ✅ Executable size verification

Manual Testing Performed:
  ✅ All 5 biomes accessible
  ✅ All 4 dungeon sizes functional
  ✅ Combat system working correctly
  ✅ Level progression accurate
  ✅ Upgrade system functional
  ✅ Auto-battle mode operational
  ✅ Save/Load system working
  ✅ Statistics tracking correct
  ✅ Boss encounters working

GAME DESIGN
-----------
Player Starting Stats:
  Level: 1
  Health: 100/100
  Attack: 10
  Defense: 5
  Gold: 0
  Experience: 0/100

Upgrade Costs (Exponential):
  Health: 50 * (1.5^upgrades)
  Attack: 100 * (1.5^upgrades)
  Defense: 80 * (1.5^upgrades)

Enemy Scaling:
  Base multiplier: 1.0 + (floor - 1) * 0.2
  Difficulty multiplier: dungeon size difficulty
  Boss multiplier: 2.5x HP, 1.5x stats

Incremental Loop:
  1. Complete easier dungeons
  2. Earn gold and experience
  3. Level up for automatic stat gains
  4. Spend gold on permanent upgrades
  5. Tackle harder dungeons
  6. Repeat with increasing power
